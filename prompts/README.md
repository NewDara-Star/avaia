# Prompts

Identity prompts for Arela agents. Paste one at the start of a session to set role and tool focus.

Quick picks:
- `delegation.md` to explain the workflow and route to the right agent.
- `archeologist.md` to bootstrap context from the codebase and scratchpad.

Use the workflow in `website/guide/workflow.md` to choose the right prompt.
