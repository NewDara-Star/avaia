# Agent Prompts

Arela ships trimmed identity prompts under `prompts/`. Paste one at the start of a session to set the agent's role and tool focus.

## Quick picks
- `prompts/archeologist.md` — Bootstrap context from the codebase and SCRATCHPAD.
- `prompts/clarification.md` — Ask high-impact questions before writing a PRD.
- `prompts/delegation.md` — Explain the workflow and route to the right agent.

## Notes
- Prompts are aligned to actual MCP tool names.
- RealUser has no browser access in Arela. It simulates from docs/spec and asks the operator if live testing is needed.
